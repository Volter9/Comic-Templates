### Wanna contribute? ###

Of course you can, if you have a comic or mock template you can definitely request a pull request and add your own template.
Keep in mind that all of your written HTML or CSS code would be copyrighted by your under *WTFPL license*.
You'll be also included in the 'authors' section for contributing a template.

However there are few rules that you need to follow:

* Completely valid semantic block based HTML5 template (tables only for data presenting).
* All assets (css, images, js) should go in their folders:
	* For CSS folder `css/`
	* For images folder `img/`
	* For JavaScript scripts use `js/` folder
* Put libraries and CSS frameworks in the root `js/`, `css/` folders (so other contributor could reuse it too).
* Name the main CSS files in a comic way, not just boring `styles.css` (E.G. you're doing Microsoft template, you could call CSS `nanosoft.css` or `picosoft.css`).
* Templates have to be inappropriately funny, but appropriate, so no drugs, sex, racism, or religion templates (sorry), however, you can *moderately* joke about these things.
* Template has to be responsive
* You can create multipage
