				<h2>Why do you need to <strong>buy</strong> our fertilizers?</h2>
				
				<p>That's all because it's our shit! That's what we do and know.</p>
				
				<p>
					Our fertilizers are 100% vegan, non toxic, gluten free, fluoride free shit. 
					We keep our animals (cow, sheep, deer) in full freedom. They eat what the hell they want.
					All we do is collecting their shit, isn't it genius? I mean, collecting shit, wrap it in beautiful packages, and then sell it.
					Genius!
				</p>
				
				<p>
					You may think, "why the hell do I have to buy your shit, if I can do it ourselves?" You're right! You can shit yourself, and then use this crap to fertilize your fields,
					but why do you need to bother with shitting and collecting your shit for farming usage? Right! You can order our fertilizers and stop worrying about collecting your shit.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					To demonstrate our reliability, we collected three reasons why you should order our shit fertilizers:
				</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>We have a lot of shit</li>
					<li>We have a lot of cheap shit</li>
					<li>We have a lot of cheap shit produced by farm animals</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
					Aren't those awesome reasons which convinces you to buy our crap? Great!
				</p>
